I have pushed the following files to github.
PyPoll_Readme.txt - This file.
main.py - The Python file containing the code.
voting_results.txt - The written file with the formatted PyPoll results.
                     When the script is executed, this file is created and written
		     in the same folder as main.py.
Resources - The folder with the CSV file given for this assignment.
